#Introduction
The files are designed for simulations with XSPEC and contains the response files and background for the HET and LET. 
These files will be regularly updated as more instrument information becomes available. With each update the version number will increase.

#V06 -> V07 major changes
	HET
	- Background has decreased
	- Effective area CBE (current best estimate)
	- Energy dependent PSF for PSFcor files
	- optimized extraction region of R=18 arcsec
	LET
	- Background has decrease and same as Athena
	- Effective area CBE
	- HPD = 3.5"
	- optimized extraction region of R=8 arcsec

# Notes
## General Simulation Remarks

To do a realistic simulation the PSFcor files with the matched background should be used.

These files can be used in XSPEC with fakeit as for example:
xspec> HEXP_HET_v07_x2_L1_R18arcsec_Ln25keV.bkg & HEXP_HET_v07.rmf & HEXP_HET_v07_PSFcor_x2.arf & y & & simulated.pha & exposuretime

Use these 'safe' fitting ranges
For the HET use 2.-80. keV
For the LET use 0.1-25. keV

## Background

The background files are matched to the PSFcor ARF files so that both have the same extraction region.

If a different scaling is desired, for example due to a different extraction region size for extended targets, it can be achieved by modifying the exposure time keyword in the background file. INCREASING the exposure time will DECREASE the background rate. Beware of the SIXTE_rate background column. Do not attempt to use this for anything as it is only intended for SIXTE.

### LET background notes

The LET background is flat and is based on the Athena WFI simulations at L1. Real backgrounds between 0.1 - 0.3 keV have a very steep tail which is not understood and is not included here. 

## Extended targets

Use the FoV averaged ARF or the ARF without PSF correction added. To scale the background region to the desired size, just modify the exposure keyword in the background header. If you desire a background that covers TWICE the area then REDUCE the exposure time by half to INCREASE the counts/c in the background region.

## PSF correction

The current best estimate of the PSF for the LET is 3.5". 
The current best estimate of the PSF for the HET is that it will be energy dependent at higher energies (>20 kev). These numbers are still TBD, and what is in the files now conservative.
We have optimized the extraction region for faint sources for both LET and HET. For LET it is 0.88, so 88% of the photons are within the extraction region. For the HET that number is now energy dependent.
